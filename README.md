Build a Database-Driven React App

# Reflection notes

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to dedicate as much time to my assignment this week as I had hoped. As a result, I wasn’t able to achieve many of the goals I had set for myself, despite having the knowledge to implement them, which has been a bit frustrating. Some of the features I had planned to include but didn’t have time for were: drag-and-drop functionality between columns, editable posts, a profile page, dynamic data for the dashboard, and overall improved responsiveness. I would have also liked to spend more time designing my app.
